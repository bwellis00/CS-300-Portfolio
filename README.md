# CS300 Data and Analysis Projects

## Questions and Answers

### 1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course, we tackled problems involving various data models such as Binary Trees, Hash Tables, and Linked Lists. The main objective was to understand their appropriate usage within different applications.

### 2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by analyzing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each data structure. Understanding these aspects allowed me to apply the most suitable data structure where its strengths outweighed its weaknesses. Data structures are essential because they offer different ways to organize and manipulate data efficiently, which is crucial for optimizing performance and resource management.

### 3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks, I employed several strategies:
- **Research**: I consulted official documentation and searched for example implementations.
- **Prototyping**: I created small, simple prototype code elements and gradually extended them as the logic became more complex.
- **Experimentation**: I experimented with different approaches to find the most effective solution.

### 4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on these projects has expanded my approach by emphasizing the importance of performance analysis, particularly through Big-O notation. It made me more conscious of algorithmic efficiency and highlighted the need to improve my understanding of recursive thinking, which is vital for certain types of problem-solving.

### 5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
My work on this project has significantly improved my programming practices:
- **Maintainability**: Through repeated practice, I have developed common functions for recurring tasks, which I now use as prototypes.
- **Readability**: I focus on writing clean, well-documented code that is easy to understand.
- **Adaptability**: I am considering developing reusable libraries for frequently used elements, making my code more adaptable to future changes.

Overall, this course has enhanced my skills in designing efficient, maintainable, and adaptable software solutions.
